%%% NEED THESE %%%
% random square matrices 
% matrices with specific eigenvalues 
% matrices with specific singular values 
% ill-conditioned matrices 
% sparse matrices
% inconsistent/consistent least square matrices 

%%% MAYBE %%%
% comparison with lsqr and lsmr? 
% comparison with the naive solve

%% on average, matlab uses 0.0024 sec on matrix-vector product for 
%% 2000-2000, and Eigen uses 0.0036
